    "### Task 6: Iterate!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you may be ecstatic or baffled with your results. Either way, the point now is to try and iteratively improve your approach so that your team is satisfied with the model's performance or thinks they can justify their decisions and the model's behavior. Now that you made your first way through, take the time to think about changing your data engineering process, model architecture, selection methods, etc. to try and improve results. Recall that \"improving\" can mean different things for different folks based on your priorities. For some that will mean enhancing the accuracy of the model on the employees. For others it will be rectifying the disparate outcomes on the candidate dataset. Some will need to narrow their selection rate overall, ohers will need to widen it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your team may not arrive at an approach you are wholly satisfied with - that's totally alright! Sometimes these problems can seem or even be intractable. Nonetheless, along each of these tasks (1-5), unless you're perfectly happy with the results, you should try at least one to two changes per stage and see what effect it has. You'll need to discuss that experimentation in this final task.\n"

    "### Final Task: Memo Write-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright time to finally put your writing cap back on.  Now that you've come to an approach you're satisfied with (or settled on), the GC\"s office wants a ~2 page write-up of your approach, its advantages, disadvantages, threats of statutory liability, and defenses you should lay out the memo in the following manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memo Outline & Additional Questions....\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline Guide to the Memo\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe your team's model, the architecture, selected features, and data steps.\n",
    "    - What are some advantages or benefical \"features\" of your overall approach?\n",
    "    - What are some disadvantages or risks with your approach?\n",
    "- Data Handling\n",
    "    - Starting with Data Engineering, describe how your team decided on the features, performance measure, and label generation method that you ended up with.\n",
    "    - How did you go about making your decisions?\n",
    "- Model Choice\n",
    "    - How did your team choose a model? Why did you choose what you did over the other approached we covered?\n",
    "    - What were the main decision factors (performance? explainability?)? Were there hyper-parameters that you tweaked?\n",
    "- Performance - State the model's performance on the test set\n",
    "    - Accuracy, precision, recall.\n",
    "    - Also the model's fairness (using the metrics you used).\n",
    "    - What were your measures on your team's first iteration? How did you go about trying to improve it to what it is now?\n",
    "- For candidate selection\n",
    "    - How were candidates ultimately selected? How did you choose this selection method?\n",
    "    - Was there a disparate impact? If so, discuss the validity of a business necessity-type defense given your approach.\n",
    "- Race Aware Corrections -\n",
    "    - In your attempt to improve the model performance or rectify some bias/differential validity problem did you enlist any \"Race-Aware\" Corrections?\n",
    "    - Are those corrections lawful under the Ricci v. Weber case and the covered case law we reviewed on Affirmative Action Programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Hypothetical Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose manager's assessment score and the average commute time were heavily biased against minorities leaving only average deals closed, left. But suppose again that average deals closed was a highly noisy feature. A number of the recorded values were inaccurate, or altogether missing for the employees. How would you address the situation.\n",
    "2. In this case, the Supreme Court rejected a “bottom line” defense in which a defendant tried to justify a preliminary screening test with a significant disparate impact by arguing that the selection process ultimately selected protected candidates at a higher rate. Look deeper into the holding and report how your team believes this effects lawyers and engineers trying to develop automated hiring systems.\n",
    "3. Suppose your model was built such that given the current employee dataset, there was not a clear 4/5s violation in the candidate selection rates but there still existed a ~15 percent disparity between a minority group and the highest performing group.  One suggestion is to seek to gather more data on past employees to have the model train on and improve from, but this can be a costly process both in dollars and time.  How would your team go about trying to decide on a course of action? What context is key?"
