    "# A Data-Driven Approach to Job Discrimination Law\n",
    "## CS481 Assignment 1\n",
    "This assignment will place you and your team in the posture of a newly formed partnership between SprawlMart's legal and engineering departments.  We have read of rising concerns over the potentially discriminatory behavior of certain algorithmic hiring tools and now you'll be expected to address these concerns from technical, legal, and business perspectives.  SprawlMart's CEO and General Counsel have become increasingly wary of potential probes from the EEOC into its latest adoption of algorithmic hiring practices.  Moreover, apart from potential liability from the feds, a whole host of state legislatures have passed or begun to consider laws regulating the use of automated evaluation algorithms demanding explainability and transparency among other measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your team of Stanford-trained lawyers and engineers have been tasked with the job of analyzing potential problems in the latest dataset of candidates applying for SprawlMart's coveted Entry-Level Business/Data Analyst Position. You will be tasked with analyzing the liability risks that the company faces and prototyping a system that shields the corporation from those risks while balancing other key corporate objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "* Gain basic command over concepts in data science and machine learning as it relates to legal statutes. \n",
    "* Gain a robust understanding of where technical tools can be used as leverage to demonstrate liability under particular statutes - in this case job discrimination law. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note to self:  Was trying to say something along the lines of don't feel overwhelmed, and encourage folks to contribute and help others with what they're good at but couldn't quite phrase it right...\n",
    "\n",
    "An aside:  One of the most exciting characteristics of this class is its diversity - this cohort ranges from C.S. PhDs developing improvements in Generative Adversarial Networks to first-year Law Students well-versed in contract and tort law, to second-year English major undergrads writing prose.  We are well aware that teaching a law class in the medium of a jupyter notebook is foreign and new.  For those worried about what programming knowledge which might be required, we did not expect that you came into this class with a technical background - only that you desired to gain some of those basic skills.  If at any point, you struggle with figuring out how something in the code is working, what is being written, or just require greater clarity over what is happening from a technical viewpoint, please do not hesitate to ask for help.  For those of you who are well-versed in data science, programming, machine learning, we imagine that you came here not to learn basic skills you already know deeply but likely to learn and grapple with the interesting legal puzzles and questions that arise at the intersection of the systems you build and the laws of the land. In sum, we hope that this will be a rich experience, where every party not only gains valuable skills but also has the opportunity to demonstrate their own skillset and assist their teammates. If at any point you feel that is not the case please offer your feedback! \n"

    "1. Studying a proprietary dataset of candidates for potential legal liability under Job Discrimination statutes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Building a compliant hiring algorithm that meets compliance measures and corporate objectives.  \n",

    "3. Analyzing performance, and considering the legal implications of fairness-correcting measures. \n"

    "### Milestone 1:  Analyzing the Data for Legal Liability \n",
    "To start your team's analysis and task, you've been handed the latest dataset of 500 candidates being evaluated for the next cohort of entry-level business analysts.  Moreover, along with the datset HR's engineering team has also kindly shared with you three basic algorithms they've used in the past to evaluate candidates.  In practice, the inclusion of this automated system is planned for use in the initial evaluation phrase, prior to any in-person interviews.  Those scoring in the top 30% will move on to the next phase of evaluation by an actual recruiter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that under the existing federal statutes - there exists three evidentiary frameworks to detect discriminatory intent: direct, indirect, and statistical. ([Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/research/assessing-employer-intent-when-ai-hiring-tools-are-biased/)).  We will focus on statistical evidence although we encourage you to repeatedly consider other potential sources of liability.  As discussed in lecture, the EEOC has adopted a 4/5ths rule of thumb to quantify a \"substantially different rate of selection\" that could lend to liability risk under the Title VII apart from a demonstration of business necessity (NEEDS CITATION). The courts have generally upheld the rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The 4/5ths rule states that if the selection rate for a certain group (X) is less than 80 percent of that of the group with the highest selection rate (Y), there is adverse impact on that group (X). [Types of Employment Discrimination](https://www.justice.gov/crt/types-employment-discrimination) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning goals for this Milestone\n",
    "##### Job Discrimination Law\n",
    "* Acquire a deep understanding of where liability under the EEOC's 4/5ths rule may apply in the context of job discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A Basic Technical Toolset\n",
    "* A basic but fundamental and actionable understanding of how data is used to make predictions\n",
    "* Learn how legal standards of liability connect with the analysis of datasets.\n",
    "* Exposure to more modern data sources for job evaluation, corresponding evaluation algorithms and their legal risk."

    "We have 4 previous model employees that we've labelled in terms of their performance - their names are Jane, Oscar, John, and Beatrice. Jane is an excellent worker, Oscar is a good worker, John, is a satisfactory worker, and Beatrice was a poor worker. Moreover, we have the same 22 data points for each of them as we do for each of candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This is how the model works:\n",
    "    * Choose the data points we believe are most expressive of our 4 model employees' performance\n",
    "    * For each of the candidates:\n",
    "        * For each of the model employees\n",
    "            * Calculate the \"distance\" between the candidate and the particular model employee\n",
    "        * Pick out the label of model employee that has the least distance, is closest, to the candidate\n",
    "        * Assign that label to the candidate.\n",
    "    * Select all candidates with \"excellent\" predictions for the next round of interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few technical notes:\n",
    "* If you're wondering what we mean by distance, please skim through this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/importance-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning-modelling-e51395ffe60d).  In some cases distance measures are very intuitive.  For example if Jane has a 3.9 GPA, and a candidate Sally has a 3.8 GPA.  There is little distance between these two  with regard to that measure.  But other times distance measures can be far less intuitive.  For example, consider how we've encoded race.  It seems really wacky, that one race can be more or less distant from another race. Think back to where you considered potential worries regarding some of the ways these features were encoded.  This is where those concerns might come up! \n",
    "* A second difficulty that comes into play is that given the distance measure/function we choose, different features will contribute more or less distance to the total calculation."
