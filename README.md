CS481/LAW4045 Digital Law & Technology (Spring '21) beta version 1.0
Module 1: Algorithmic Hiring & Job Discrimination Law

Instructions to Viewers:

There are two milestones in two folders, Milestone1 and Milestone2.
Within each Milestone, there are 3 exercises, students will be expected to work through and complete questions in.

In Milestone 1 there are the following exercises
- Labelling 
- A Naive Ranking Model
- A Nearest Neighbor Model

In Milestone 2 there are the following exercises
- Intro & Linear Regression
- Classifier
- Build Your own model

Exercises are meant to be completed in order. Students will be asked to fill in particular code blocks, justify/explain their actions/approaches, and write up answers to particular theoretical/conceptual questions.

Currently in development we are still working through the dataset's generation and distribution among different groups of individuals to get students to wrestle with various biases that might appear in real-life situations.

NOTE: Exercise 3 in Milestone 1 must be downloaded locally and viewed in your own jupyter notebook client as the file on its own is too big! Has an audio clip in it!

Please email comments, concerns, questions, bugs you come across to jonahwu@stanford.edu - I'd greatly appreciate any feedback you can offer.
