    "In the previous milestone we considered various models for the evaluation of candidates at Sprawlmart, and we mainly evaluated those algorithms based off of compliance with anti-discrimination statutes that we learned.  However, in a corporation, that is clearly not the only metric a model must obtain. More importantly, the model has to actually accomplish the goal defined by your objective.  In Sprawlmart's case that is selecting the best candidates. Those who are most capable of the job.\n",
