    "This assignment will place you and your team in the posture of a newly formed partnership between SprawlMart's legal and engineering departments. We have read of rising concerns over the potentially discriminatory behavior of certain algorithmic hiring tools and now you'll be expected to address these concerns from technical, legal, and business perspectives. SprawlMart's CEO and General Counsel have become increasingly wary of potential probes from the EEOC into its latest adoption of algorithmic hiring practices. Moreover, apart from potential liability from the feds, a whole host of state legislatures have passed or begun to consider laws regulating the use of automated evaluation algorithms demanding explainability and transparency among other measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team of Stanford-trained lawyers and engineers have been tasked with the job of analyzing potential problems in the latest dataset of candidates applying for SprawlMart's coveted Entry-Level Business/Sales Associate Position. You will be tasked with analyzing the liability risks that the company faces and prototyping a system that shields the corporation from those risks while balancing other key corporate objectives."

    "So you've read some about these automated algorithmic hiring techniques but what do they actually do with the data fed to them?  To try and gain some intuitions, we've exposed a sample of 25 past employees, below.  Take a look at the candidates and the data features and discuss with your team to get a sense for how you would \"rank\" or \"classify them\" if you were the hiring manager."

But other times its more difficult - in our case, we might want to classify employees into certain buckets. Suppose for example that we wanted to bucket these 25 employees into five categories. \"Excellent\", \"Good\", \"Satisfactory\", \"Poor\", \"Very Poor\". \n",

You might just choose to label 5 employees based on your team's intuitive judgement of their data features, or you might try and come up with a complex formulaic method of choosing your 5, it's up to you.  \n",
